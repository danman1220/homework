\section*{Problem 1}
Suppose $f:X\to Y$ is a submersion. Prove that if $X$ is compact and $Y$ is
connected, then $f$ is surjective.
\\
\\
\begin{proof}
    Recall from the earlier homework that $f$ is an open map. Thus, the image
    $f(X)$ is open. Furthermore, since $X$ is compact, $f(X)$ is compact as
    well. Since $Y$ is Hausdorff, $f(X)$ is closed, and so $f(X)$ is a nonempty
    clopen set. Since $Y$ is connected, $f(X)=Y$ as desired.
\end{proof}<++>

\section*{Problem 2}
\subsection*{Part a}
Calculate the Lie algebra of $SO(n)$.
\\
\\
\begin{proof}
    Consider the smooth function
    \[
        \begin{aligned}
            \Phi:GL(n)\to GL(n)\\
            \Phi(A) = AA^T
        \end{aligned}
    \]
    Now, $O(n)$ is defined to be $\Phi^{-1}(I)$. We calculate the differential
    directly. Let $B\in T_A(O(n))$, and let $\gamma:[0,1]\to O(n)$ be
    \[
        \gamma(t) = A+tB
    \]
    Then,
    \[
        \begin{aligned}
            d\Phi_A(B) &= d\Phi_A(\gamma'(0))\\
            &=\partial_t(\Phi(\gamma(t)))|_0\\
            &=\partial_t((A+tB)(A+tB)^T)|_0\\
            &=\partial_t(AA^T + tAB^T + tBA^T + t^2BB^T)|_0\\
            &=AB^T + BA^T
    \end{aligned}
    \]
    Now, to show that $I$ is a regular value, we need to show that for all $A\in
    O(n)$, and for all $C\in T_{\Phi(A)}(GL(n))$, there is some $B\in T_A(O(n))$
    with $d\Phi(B)=C$.

    Take $B=\frac{1}{2}CA$, we see that
    \[
        d\Phi_A(B) = \frac{1}{2}(A(CA)^T + CAA^T) = C
    \]
    as desired. Thus, $I$ is a regular value.

    We next appeal to the fact that the tangent space of a level curve is the
    kernel of the differential. Thus, $T_I(O(n))$ is the set of all matrices for
    which
    \[
        d\Phi_I(B) = B+B^T = 0
    \]
    which is exactly $\mathfrak{o}(n)$ the set of all skew-symmetric matrices.

    Now, we will observe that $SO(n)$ is open. Consider the determinant map, a
    continuous map from $O(n)$ to the two-point set $\{-1,1\}$ with the discrete
    topology. This defines a separation of $O(n)$ into connected components.
    Specifically, the inverse image of $1$ is $SO(n)$, and thus $SO(n)$ is both
    open and closed.

    Thus, since $SO(n)$ is open, $T_I(SO(n)) = T_I(O(n)) = \mathfrak{o}(n)$ as
    desired.
\end{proof}

\subsection*{Part b}
Show $SO(n)$ is compact.
\\
\\
\begin{proof}
    To show $SO(n)$ is compact, we will show it is a closed subspace of $O(n)$,
    and show that $O(n)$ is compact. We have already observed before that
    $SO(n)$ is clopen in $O(n)$, so all we need to show is that $O(n)$ is
    compact. First, we recall that $O(n)$ is a level set, and thus is closed.
    Next, we show it is bounded. Recall that in finite-dimensional normed
    spaces, all norms are equivalent. So, we just need to show $O(n)$ is bounded
    with respect to some norm.

    Take the operator norm on $M(n)$. Then, for any $A\in O(n)$,
    \[
        \|Ax\|^2 = g(Ax,Ax) = g(A^TAx,x) = g(x,x) =\|x\|^2
    \]
    and so $\|A\|=1$. Thus, $O(n)$ is bounded by $1$ in operator norm. So,
    $O(n)$ is compact. Since $SO(n)$ is a closed subgroup of $O(n)$, $SO(n)$ is
    compact as well, as desired.
\end{proof}

\section*{Problem 3}
\subsection*{Part a}
Let $G$ be a subgroup of $\Diff(M)$, and suppose $p$ is fixed by $G$.
Show the map
\[
    g\mapsto dg_p
\]
is a group homomorphism $G\to GL(T_pM)$.
\\
\\
\begin{proof}
    We just need to show that this map respects the group operation. That is, we
    need to show that
    \[
        d(gh)_p = dg_p\circ dh_p
    \]
    but this is just a restatement of the functoriality of the differential,
    which has already been proven.
\end{proof}

\subsection*{Part b}
Find a basis for $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ and hence compute the dimension of $SU(2)$.
Prove that for $x,y\in\mathfrak{su}(2)$,
\[
    \text{trace}(x^*y)
\]
is a nondegenerate inner product. Deduce that there is a homomorphism
\[
    \pi:SU(2)\to SO(3)
\]

\begin{proof}
    We first calculate $\mathfrak{u}(2)$. This is just the level set of $I$
    under the function
    \[
        \Phi(A) = AA^*
    \]
    and thus $\mathfrak{u}(2)$ is the kernel of $d\Phi_I$. However, we've
    already calculated what $d\Phi_I$ does in problem 2, so
    \[
        d\Phi_I(A) = A + A^*
    \]
    which has kernel $\mathfrak{u}(2) = \{A\in M(2,\C)\ |\ A^*=-A\}$.

    Now, we observe that $SU(2)$ is the level set of $1$ under the determinant
    map. Now, we observe that
    \[
        d(\text{det}_I(A) = \text{tr}(A)
    \]
    
We begin by noting that the determinant can be expressed as
    \[
        \det(I+tA) = \sum_{\sigma\in
        S_n}\epsilon(\sigma)\prod_{i=1}^{n}(I+tA)_i^{\sigma(i)}
    \]
    Now, if we single out the linear term in the product by multiplying by $tA$
    once and then by $I$ the rest of the time, we end up with
    \[
        \begin{aligned}
            \textrm{lin}(\det(I+tA)) &= \sum_{\sigma\in S_n}
        \epsilon(\sigma)\sum_{i=1}^m(\prod_{j\neq
        i}I_j^{\sigma(j)})A_i^{\sigma(i)}t\\
            &= \sum_{i=1}^nA_i^it\\
            &=t\textrm{tr}(A)
        \end{aligned}
    \]
    and thus, the derivative at zero is $\textrm{tr}(A)$, as desired.
    Here, the equality from line 1 to line 2 is made by observing that
    $I_j^{\sigma(j)}$ is nonzero only when $\sigma(j)=j$, or when $\sigma=id$.

    Thus, $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ is the subspace of $\mathfrak{u}(2)$ such that
    $\text{tr}(A)=0$.

    Next, we compute a basis. Representing an arbitrary matrix as
    \[
\begin{bmatrix}
    a+bi &c+di\\
    f+gi &h+ki
\end{bmatrix}
    \]
    the trace-free requirement says that $a=-h$ and $b=-k$, and skew-symmetry
    says that $a=h=0$, $c=-f$ and  $d=g$. Thus, a typical matrix in
    $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ is
    \[
\begin{bmatrix}
    bi & c+di\\
    -c+di &-bi
\end{bmatrix}
    \]
    which has basis
    \[
        \left\{ 
            \begin{bmatrix}
                0&1\\
                -1&0
            \end{bmatrix}
            \begin{bmatrix}
                i&0\\
                0&i
            \end{bmatrix}
            \begin{bmatrix}
                0&i\\
                i&0
            \end{bmatrix}
        \right\}
    \]
    and thus has dimension $3$.
    \\
    \\
    Next, we show that $\text{trace}(x^*y)$ is an inner product on this space.
    First, we show this is symmetric. To see this, we calculate
    \[
        \text{trace}(x^*y) = \text{trace}(-xy) = \text{trace}(y(-x)) =
        \text{trace}(-yx) = \text{trace}(y^*x)
    \]
    and so this is symmetric. Next, we show it is linear in the first term. This
    follows directly: let $x,y,z\in \mathfrak{su}(2)$. Then,
    \[
        \text{trace}((x+z)^*y) = \text{trace}((-x-z)y) = \text{trace}(x^*y) +
        \text{trace}(z^*y)
    \]
    and for $\alpha\in \R$,
    \[
        \text{trace}((\alpha x)^*y) = \text{trace}(\alpha x^*y) =
        \alpha\text{trace}(x^*y)
    \]
    and thus this form is linear in the first term.

    Finally, we need to show that this is a nondegenerate form. For nonzero
    $x\in \mathfrak{su}(2)$, let
    \[
        x=
\begin{bmatrix}
    bi & c+di\\
    -c+di &-bi
\end{bmatrix}
    \]
    Then,
    \[
        \text{trace}(x^*x) = 2(b^2+c^2+d^2) \geq 0
    \]
    with equality if and only if $x=0$.

    Finally, we deduce that there is a homomorphism
    \[
        \pi:SU(2)\to SO(3)
    \]
    which is the well-known double cover of $SO(3)$.
\end{proof}

\section*{Problem 4}
\subsection*{Part a}
Let $p$ be a homogeneous polynomial. Prove that any $a\neq 0$ is a regular value
of $p$.
\\
\\
\begin{proof}
    We calculate the differential directly.
    \[
        (dp)_aX^a = X^a\nabla_ap = X^a\partial_ap
    \]
    Now, let $\beta\in p^{-1}(a)$. We wish to show $dp_{\beta}$ is surjective.
    Since its codomain has dimension one, we just need to show it has nontrivial
    image. So, we see that
    \[
        ((dp)_{\beta})_a\beta^a = \beta^a\partial_ap|_{\beta} = ma
    \]
    by Euler's identity for homogeneous polynomials. Thus, if $a\neq 0$, then
    $a$ is a regular value, as desired.
\end{proof}

\subsection*{Part b}
Deduce that $SL(n,\R)$ is a Lie group.
\\
\\
\begin{proof}
    Observe that $SL(n)$ is the inverse image of $1$ under the determinant map.
    Now, for arbitrary $n\times n$ matrices, the determinant is a homogeneous
    polynomial of $n^2$ variables (the entries of the matrix), and thus $1$ is a
    regular value of the determinant. Thus, $SL(n)$ is a submanifold of $GL(n)$,
    and is a Lie group, as desired.
\end{proof}
