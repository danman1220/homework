\section*{Problem 1}
Let $M$ be a complete Riemannian manifold with non-positive sectional curvature.
Prove that
\[
    |(d\exp_p)_v(w)|\geq |w|
\]
for all $p\in M$, $v\in T_pM$, and $w\in T_v(T_pM)$.
\\
\\
\begin{proof}
    We compare $M$ to Euclidean space $\R^n$, noting that $K = K_M \leq
    \tilde{K} = K_{\R^n} = 0$. Now, let $\gamma(t) = \exp_p(tv)$ be the geodesic
    generated by $v$ in $M$, and observe that
    \[
        (d\exp_p)_{tv}(tw)
    \]
    is a Jacobi field along $\gamma$ (in fact, this is the first Jacobi field Do
    Carmo studies in chapter 5). Since $M$ is complete, such a field is defined,
    as $\exp_p(tv)$ is defined.

    Now, in $\R^n$, we construct $\tilde{\gamma}(t) = \exp_0(tv) = tv$ and
    note that
    \[
        \tilde{J}(t) = (d\exp_0)_{tv}(tw) = tw
    \]
    Now, clearly
    \[
        \|\gamma'(t)\| = \|\tilde{\gamma}'(t)\| = v
    \]
    and
    \[
        J(0) = \tilde{J}(0) = 0
    \]
    and
    \[
        g(J'(0),\gamma'(0)) = g(\tilde{J}'(0),\tilde{\gamma}'(0)) = g(w,v)
    \]
    and
    \[
        \|J'(0)\| = \|\tilde{J}'(0)\| = \|w\|
    \]
    and since $M$ has non-positive sectional curvature, $\gamma$ has no
    conjugate points. Thus, the hypotheses for the Rauch comparison theorem are
    satisfied, and immediately we know that
    \[
        |\tilde{J}(t)| \leq |J(t)|
    \]
    plugging in $t=1$, we observe that
    \[
        |(d\exp_p)_{v}(w)| \geq |w|
    \]
    as desired.
\end{proof}

\section*{Problem 2}
Let
\[
    f''(t) + K(t)f(t) = 0, f(0)=0, t\in [0,\ell]
\]
\[
    \tilde{f}''(t) + \tilde{K}(t)\tilde{f}(t) = 0, \tilde{f}(0)=0, t\in [0,\ell]
\]
be two ODEs. Suppose $\tilde{K}(t)\geq K(t)$ for $t\in[0,\ell]$ and that
$f'(0)=\tilde{f}'(0)=1$.

\subsection*{Part a}
Show that for all $t\in [0,\ell]$,
\[
    \begin{aligned}
    0 &= \int_0^t\left\{ \tilde{f}(f''+Kf) - f(\tilde{f}'' +
    \tilde{K}\tilde{f}) \right\}dt\\
        &= [\tilde{f}f' - f\tilde{f}']_0^t +
    \int_0^t(K-\tilde{K})f\tilde{f}dt
    \end{aligned}
\]
and conclude that the first zero of $f$ does not occur before the first zero of
$\tilde{f}$.
\\
\\
\begin{proof}
    The first equality follows immediately from the differential equation. That
    is,
    \[
     \int_0^t\left\{ \tilde{f}(f''+Kf) - f(\tilde{f}'' +
     \tilde{K}\tilde{f}) \right\}dt = \int_0^t\tilde{f}(0) - f(0) dt = 0
    \]
    for the second equality, we integrate by parts. Noticing that
    \[
        \int_0^t\tilde{f}f''dt = [\tilde{f}f']_0^t - \int_0^t\tilde{f}'f'dt
    \]
    we see that
    \[
        \begin{aligned}
     \int_0^t\left\{ \tilde{f}(f''+Kf) - f(\tilde{f}'' +
     \tilde{K}\tilde{f}) \right\}dt\\
        &= \int_0^t\tilde{f}f''dt - \int_0^tf\tilde{f}''dt +
        \int_0^tK\tilde{f}fdt - \int_0^t\tilde{K}\tilde{f}fdt\\
        &=[\tilde{f}f']_0^t - \int_0^t\tilde{f}'f'dt - [f\tilde{f}']_0^t +
        \int_0^t\tilde{f}'f'dt + \int_0^t(K-\tilde{K})f\tilde{f}dt\\
        &=[\tilde{f}f'-f\tilde{f}']_0^t + \int_0^t(K-\tilde{K})f\tilde{f}dt
        \end{aligned}
    \]
    as desired.

    Now, we know that $f(t)>0$ on a neighborhood of zero. Let $t_0$ be the first
    zero of $\tilde{f}$ (so $\tilde{f}(t)>0$ for $t<t_0$). Assume for
    contradiction that for some $t_1<t_0$, $f(t_1)=0$. Furthermore, suppose this
    is the first zero (that is $f(t)>0$ for $t< t_1$). Then, $f'(t_1)<0$,
    $\tilde{f}(t_1)>0$, and so
    \[
        \begin{aligned}
            \left[\tilde{f}f'-f\tilde{f}'\right]_0^{t_1} +
            \int_0^{t_1}(K-\tilde{K})f\tilde{f}dt
            &= \tilde{f}(t_1)f'(t_1)-f(t_1)\tilde{f}'(t_1) +
            \int_0^{t_1}(K-\tilde{K}f\tilde{f}dt\\
            &= \tilde{f}(t_1)f'(t_1) +
            \int_0^{t_1}(K-\tilde{K}f\tilde{f}dt\\
        \end{aligned}
    \]
    now $\tilde{f}(t_1)>0$, $f'(t_1)<0$, $(K-\tilde{K})<0$ and
    $f(t)\tilde{f}(t)>0$ for $t<t_1$. Thus,
    \[
            \tilde{f}(t_1)f'(t_1) +
            \int_0^{t_1}(K-\tilde{K}f\tilde{f}dt <0
    \]
    a contradiction.
\end{proof}

\subsection*{Part b}
Suppose $\tilde{f}(t)>0$ on $(0,\ell]$. Show that $f(t)\geq \tilde{f}(t)$ for
$t\in [0,\ell]$, and equality holds for $t=t_1$ if and only if
$K(t)=\tilde{K}(t)$ on $[0,t_1]$.
\\
\\
\begin{proof}
    From the first equality in part a, and that $\tilde{f}(t),f(t)>0$, we see
    that in order for
    \[
    0 = [\tilde{f}f' - f\tilde{f}']_0^t +
    \int_0^t(K-\tilde{K})f\tilde{f}dt
    \]
    is satisfied only when
    \[
        [\tilde{f}f' - f\tilde{f}']_0^t = \tilde{f}(t)f'(t) -
        f(t)\tilde{f}'(t) > 0
    \]
    or,
    \[
        \frac{f'}{f}\geq \frac{\tilde{f}'}{\tilde{f}}
    \]
    In other words,
    \[
        (\log f)'\geq (\log \tilde{f})'
    \]

    Integrating this from $t_0$ to $t$, we see that
    \[
        \log f(t) - \log f(t_0)\geq \log \tilde{f}(t) - \log\tilde{f}(t_0)
    \]
    which implies that
    \[
        \frac{f(t)}{\tilde{f}(t)}\geq \frac{f(t_0)}{\tilde{f}(t_0)}
    \]
    taking the limit as $t_0\to 0$ and noting that $f(0)=\tilde{f}(0)=0$ (and
    applying l'Hopital's rule), we see that
    \[
        \frac{f(t)}{\tilde{f}(t)}\geq \frac{f'(0)}{\tilde{f}'(0)} = 1
    \]
    and the desired result is achieved.
\end{proof}

\section*{Problem 3}
Prove that if $M$ is complete and the sectional curvature satisfies
$K\geq\delta>0$, then $M$ is compact and $\text{diam}(M)\leq
\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{\delta}}$.
\\
\\
\begin{proof}
    We appeal to (half of) proposition 2.4 in chapter 10 of Do Carmo, which
    states that if $M$ is such that the sectional curvature $K$ satisfies
    \[
        0<\delta\leq K
    \]
    then the distance $d$ along two consecutive conjugate points of $\gamma$ a
    geodesic in $M$ satisfies
    \[
        d\leq \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{\delta}}
    \]
    
    So, if $\gamma$ is a geodesic in $M$ with $\gamma(0)=p$ for $p\in M$, then
    the first conjugate point to $\gamma(0)$ is at most a distance
    $\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{\delta}}$ away. 
    
    So, let $\gamma$ be a minimizing geodesic connecting $p$ and $q$, and
    suppose for a contradiction that the length of $\gamma$ is greater than
    $\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{\delta}}$. Then, by the above observation, $\gamma$ has a
    conjugate point between $p$ and $q$, which contradicts $\gamma$ being a
    minimal geodesic.

    Thus, the diameter of $M$ is bounded above by $\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{\delta}}$ as
    desired.
\end{proof}

\section*{Problem 4}
Recall the definition of the Hessian as
\[
    \Hess(f)Y = \nabla_Y\text{grad}f
\]
\subsection*{Part a}
Prove that the Laplacian is given as
\[
    \Delta f = \tr \Hess f
\]

\begin{proof}
    We'll proceed in Einstein index notation. Recall that
    \[
        \nabla_YT = Y^a\nabla_aT^{bcd\dots}_{efg\dots}
    \]
    and we can raise and lower indices using
    \[
        T_a = g_{ab}T^b
    \]
    Now, we rewrite the Hessian as
    \[
        (\Hess(f)Y)^a = Y^b\nabla_b(df)^a = Y^b\nabla_b(g^{ac}(df)_c)
    \]
    (by observing that $(\text{grad}f)^a = g^{ab}(df)_b$)
    or
    \[
        \Hess(f)^a_b = \nabla_b(df)^a
    \]
    and the trace is
    \[
        \tr\Hess(f) = (\Hess(f))^a_a = \nabla_a(df)^a = \nabla_a(g^{ab}(df)_b)
    \]
    We compare this to the Laplacian, defined as
    \[
        \Delta f = \text{div grad}f
    \]
    which can be expressed in index notation as
    \[
        \Delta f = \nabla_a(df)^a
    \]
    and equality is immediately observed.

\end{proof}

\subsection*{Part b}
Prove that
\[
    g(\Hess(f)Y,X) = g(Y,\Hess(f)X)
\]
\begin{proof}
    We note that this is equivalent to showing that
    \[
        \Hess(f)_{ab} = g_{ac}\Hess(f)^c_b
    \]
    is symmetric in its lower indices.

    We proceed with index gymnastics.
    \[
        \begin{aligned}
            \Hess(f)_{ab} &= g_{ac}\nabla_b(df)^c\\
            &= g_{ac}\nabla_bg^{cd}\nabla_df\\
            &= g_{ac}g^{cd}\nabla_b\nabla_df\\
            &= g_{ac}g^{cd}\nabla_b\partial_df\\
            &= g_{ac}g^{cd}\partial_b\partial_df - \Gamma^e_{bd}\partial_ef\\
            &= g_{ac}g^{cd}\partial_d\partial_bf - \Gamma^e_{db}\partial_ef\\
            &= g_{ac}g^{cd}\nabla_d\nabla_bf\\
            &= \nabla_a\nabla_bf\\
            &= g_{bc}\nabla_a(df)^c
            &=\Hess(f)_{ba}
    \end{aligned}
    \]
    as desired.
\end{proof}

\section*{Problem 5}
Let $G$ be a Lie group with trivial center. Prove that if $G$ carries a
bi-invariant metric, then both $G$ and its universal cover are compact.
\\
\\
\begin{proof}
    Recall from Do Carmo chapter 2 that if $G$ has a bi-invariant metric $g$,
    then the adjoint representation
    \[
        \Ad:G\to\Aut(\mathfrak{g})
    \]
    respects the metric. That is,
    \[
        \Ad(G)\subset O(\mathfrak{g},g)
    \]
    Now, the kernel of $\Ad$ is the center of $G$, and since this is trivial,
    $G$ injects into $O(\mathfrak{g},g)$. Since $O(n)$ is compact, and $\Ad(G)$
    is closed, it follows that $\Ad(G)\cong G$ is compact as well.

    Now, since $G$ admits a bi-invariant metric, it follows from Do Carmo
    chapter 4 exercise 1 that (since $G$ has trivial center) the sectional
    curvature of $G$ is strictly positive. Then, by corollary 3.3 in chapter 9
    of Do Carmo, we see that $M$ has a finite fundamental group. Thus, its
    universal cover is finite-sheeted, and a finite-sheeted cover of a compact
    space is compact.
\end{proof}
