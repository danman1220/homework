\section*{Problem 1}
Show that for two nontrivial groups $G$ and $H$, their free product $G\star H$
has trivial center, and that the only elements of finite order are the
conjugates of finite order elements in $G$ and $H$.
\\
\\
\begin{proof}
    We first show that the free product has a trivial center. To show this, we
    will consider two cases of elements from $G\star H$. First, observe
    that for any element $g\in G$ with $g\neq e$, $g$ (or rather, the inclusion
    of $g$ into $G\star H$) cannot be in the center $Z(G\star H)$. To see this,
    let $h\in H$ with $h\neq e$, and note that the element $ghg^{-1}h^{-1}$ is a
    reduced word in the free group, and cannot be equal to the identity. Thus,
    $gh\neq hg$, and $g$ is not in $Z(G\star H)$.  Similarly, any element $h\in
    H$ is not in $Z(G\star H)$.

    Now, let $w$ be a reduced word in $G\star H$ that is not in $G$ or $H$.
    Without loss of generality, we can write
    \[
        w = g_1h_1g_2h_2\dots g_nh_n
    \]
    or
    \[
        w = g_1h_1g_2h_2\dots g_n
    \]
    for $g_i\in G$, and $h_i\in H$. Now, since $G$ and $H$ have no relations to
    each other, this word is not equal to any word beginning with an element of
    $H$. Suppose for a contradiction that
    \[
        w = h'_1g'_1h'_2g'_2\dots h'_mg'_m
    \]
    with $g'_m$ possibly equal to the identity.
    This would imply that
    \[
        g_1h_1g_2h_2\dots g_nh_n = h'_1g'_1h'_2g'_2\dots h'_mg'_m
    \]
    which would imply the relation
    \[
        g_1h_1g_2h_2\dots g_nh_n(g'_m)^{-1}(h'_m)^{-1}\dots
        (g'_1)^{-1}(h'_1)^{-1} = e
    \]
    Now, if $g'_m\neq e$, the word on the left hand side is already reduced, and
    thus cannot be equal to $e$. If $g'_m=e$, then the word could reduce
    further. However, note that this word only reduces further if adjacent
    elements from the same group cancel to the identity (that is, if adjacent
        elements from the same group do not cancel to the identity, then
    the word is reduced, and in particular is not equal to the identity). Now,
    careful counting of the elements of the word reveals that the (unreduced)
    word has one more element from $H$ than it does elements from $G$. So, the
    total number of elements in the unreduced word is odd. Clearly, then, we
    cannot cancel in pairs to get the identity. 
    Therefore, this relation cannot be true, and thus $w$ cannot be written as a
    word beginning with an element from $H$.

    It follows immediately, then, that $wh\neq hw$ for $h\in H$ a nontrivial
    element, since $wh$ is a word beginning with an element of $G$, and $hw$ is
    a word beginning with an element of $H$.

    Thus, no element in $G\star H$ is in the center, as desired.
    \\
    \\
    Next, we show that every element of finite order is the conjugate of a
    finite order element of $G$ or $H$. So, let $w$ be a word in $G\star H$ with
    $w^n = e$. Without loss of generality, let the first term of $w$ be from
    $G$.

    If $w = g_1h_1\dots g_nh_n$, then the concatenation $w^n$ is already reduced
    (since adjacent elements are from different groups) and in particular cannot
    be equal to the identity.

    So, suppose $w = g_1h_1\dots h_{n-1}g_{n}$, with $w^n = e$. Now, for this to
    be true, it must be that $g_n=g_1^{-1}$. If this were not the case, the
    concatenated word $w^n$ would be reduced already (by treating $g_ng_1$ as an
    element of $G$) since $g_ng_1$ is adjacent to only elements of $H$.
    Continuing the argument, we find that $h_{n-1} = h_1^{-1}$,
    $g_{n-1}=g_2^{_1}$ and so on, save for the central term (since $w$ has odd
    length). If $n$ is even, the central term is $h_{\frac{n}{2}}$, and if $n$
    is odd, the central term is $g_{\frac{n+1}{2}}$. For the sake of simplicity,
    we will assume that $n$ is odd, but the proof works the same way for $n$
    even.

    Now, we know that
    \[
        w = g_1h_1g_2h_2\dots h_{\frac{n+1}{2}-1}
        g_{\frac{n+1}{2}}h_{\frac{n+1}{2}-1}^{-1}\dots h_2^{-1}g_2^{-1}h_1^{-1}g_1^{-1}
    \]
    which is just
    \[
        w= (g_1h_1g_2h_2\dots
        h_{\frac{n+1}{2}-1})g_{\frac{n+1}{2}}(g_1h_1g_2h_2\dots
        h_{\frac{n+1}{2}-1})^{-1}
    \]
    and thus $w$ is a conjugate of an element of $G$. Now for $w^n = e$ it must
    be that 
    \[
        w^n = 
        (g_1h_1g_2h_2\dots
        h_{\frac{n+1}{2}-1})g^n_{\frac{n+1}{2}}(g_1h_1g_2h_2\dots
        h_{\frac{n+1}{2}-1})^{-1} = e
    \]
    which is only true if $g^n = e$.

    Thus, the elements of finite order in $G\star H$ are all conjugates of
    elements of finite order in $G$ or $H$.

    Finally, we observe that every element that is the conjugate of an element
    of finite order in $G$ (or $H$) is of finite order. Let $g\in G$ with $g^n =
    e$, and observe that for any $w\in G\star H$, we have that
    \[
        (wgw^{-1})^n = wg^nw^{-1} = ww^{-1} = e
    \]
    and so $wgw^{-1}$ has finite order as well.

    Thus the elements of finite order in $G\star H$ are exactly the conjugates
    of elements of finite order in $G$ or $H$, as desired.
\end{proof}

\section*{Problem 2}
Let $X\subset \R^n$ be the union of convex open sets $X_1,\dots,X_n$ such that
$X_i\cap X_j\cap X_k\neq\emptyset$ for all $i,j,k$. Prove that $X$ is simply
connected.
\\
\\
\begin{proof}
    This proof will be done inductively on the number of convex open sets used
    to union to $X$. Now, convex sets have a distinct property which makes them
    nice for this problem. Namely, if $X$ is a convex set, and $\gamma$ is a
    path in $X$, $\gamma$ is homotopic to the line segment from $\gamma(0)$ to
    $\gamma(1)$. This is clear; since convex sets are simply connected, all
    paths with fixed endpoints are homotopic to each other, and since each
    convex set is convex, it contains the straight line path from $\gamma(0)$ to
    $\gamma(1)$.

    Now, let's first prove the base case of $n=2$. For this, let $f$ be a loop
    in $X$ based at $x_0$. Without loss of generality, we let $x_0\in X_1$. Now,
    if $f$ stays in $X_1$, then it is nullhomotopic since $X_1$ is simply
    connected. Now, suppose $f$ enters $X_2$ at some time $t_1$, exits $X_1$ at
    some $t>t_1$, and exits $X_2$ at $t_2>t$. Then, the segment $f|_{[t_1,t_2]}$
    is homotopic to the straight line from $f(t_1)$ to $f(t_2)$, which is in
    $X_1$. Repeating this for the (finite) number of times $f$ exits $X_1$, we
    see that $f$ is homotopic to a loop that stays in $X_1$, and is thus
    nullhomotopic.

    Now suppose the theorem holds for the union of $n-1$ convex sets with the
    triple intersection property, and let $X$ be the union of $n$ convex sets
    with the same property. Let $f$ be a loop in $X$ based at $x_0\in X_1$. Now,
    if $f$ stays in $\cup_{i=1}^{n-1}X_i$ (that is, if $f$ avoids being in only
    $X_n$), then $f$ is a loop in the union of $n-1$ convex sets with the triple
    intersection property, and is nullhomotopic. 
    
    So, suppose $f$ enters $X_n$ at
    some time $t_1$ from a set $X_i$, leaves $X_i$ at some $t>t_1$, then leaves
    $X_n$ in $X_j\cap X_n$ at some $t_2$. Now, by the triple intersection
    property, we know that $X_i\cap X_j\cap X_n \neq \emptyset$, so let $x$ be a
    point in the common intersection. Now, since $f(t_1)$, $f(t_2)$, and $x$ are
    all in $X_n$, so is the path taking the straight line from $f(t_1)$ to $x$,
    then the straight line from $x$ to $f(t_2)$. Then, the segment
    $f|_{[t_1,t_2]}$ is homotopic to this path from $f(t_1)$ through $x$ to
    $f(t_2)$. However, since $f(t_1)$ and $x$ are in $X_i$, so is the straight
    line connecting them. Furthermore, since $x$ and $f(t_2)$ are in $X_j$, so
    is the straight line connecting them. Thus, $f|_{[t_1,t_2]}$ is homotopic to
    a path that stays in $X_i$ and $X_j$. Repeating this process for the
    (finite) number of times $f$ stays in $X_n$ alone, we see that $f$ is
    homotopic to a loop that stays in $\cup_{i=1}^{n-1}X_i$, and by the
    inductive hypothesis, $f$ is nullhomotopic as desired.

\end{proof}

\section*{Problem 3}
Show that the complement of a finite set of points in $\R^n$ is simply connected
if $n\geq 3$.
\\
\\
\begin{proof}
    Let $X$ be a set of $m$ points in $\R^n$ and without loss of generality let
    $0\not\in X$. We wish to calculate $\pi_1(\R^n\setminus X)$. To do so, we
    will establish that $\R^n\setminus X$ deformation retracts onto the $m$-fold
    wedge of $S^{n-1}$.

    Consider the following process. First, take $r$ large enough so that the
    ball $B_r(0)$ of radius $r$ at zero contains all of $X$. Now, outside of
    $B_r(0)$ we can define a deformation retraction onto $\partial B_r(0)$.
    Inside, however, we have to be more careful. We will define a subspace $C$ as
    follows: around each point in $X$, expand a sphere centered at that point at
    uniform speed. Now, wherever two spheres collide (or one collides with the
    boundary $\partial B_r(0)$), the point of collision remains fixed, and the
    rest of the sphere keeps expanding. This process eventually terminates,
    since the spheres will eventually hit the boundary $\partial B_r(0)$, and
    the result is a closed subspace $C$ of $\bar{B}_r(0)$ such that the
    complement $B_r(0)\setminus C$ has $m$ components, with each component
    containing exactly one point of $X$.
    
    More generally, this process defines a deformation retract of $B_r(0)$ onto
    $C$. The deformation retract moves points along the expanding spheres until
    they reach $C$. Since all the spheres eventually expand to $C$, this is
    well-defined for all of $B_r(0)$.

    So, all we need to show is that $C$ has a trivial fundamental group. (Note
        that $C$ contains $\partial B_r(0)$, so it contains the retract of the
    points outside $B_r(0)$).
    This is clear, however, since $C$ is homeomorphic to
