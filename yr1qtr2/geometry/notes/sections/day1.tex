\section{Preliminaries}

\begin{hw}
    Prove that $V^{**}\cong V$ for finite-dimensional vector space $V$.
\end{hw}

From this, it is clear that $T_p^*M\otimes T_pM\cong \textrm{Hom}(T_pM,T_pM)$
for a manifold $M$.

Recall the tangent bundle $TM$ is defined as
\[
    TM = \coprod_{p\in M} T_pM
\]
and a vector field on the manifold $M$ is simply a section of the tangent bundle
projection
$\begin{tikzcd}TM\arrow{r}{\pi} &M\end{tikzcd}$. In other words, a vector field
    is a function $f:M\to TM$ such that $\pi\circ f = id$.
Requiring the section to be smooth makes it into a smooth vector field.

We can also do the same thing for the cotangent bundle $T^*M$ to obtain a
covector field.

Now, we can take the tensor product of copies of $TM$ and $T^*M$ to obtain our
tensor bundles, and tensor fields will be sections of these bundles.

Let $(U,\phi)$ be a smooth chart on $M$ with coordinate functions $x^i$,
coordinate vector fields $\partial_i$, and coordinate one-forms $dx^i$. Recall
that $dx^i$ is defined to be the dual basis to $\partial_i$, that is,
\[
    dx^i(\partial_j) = \delta^i_j
\]

Recall also that the exterior derivative of a function $df$ is defined as
\[
    df(v) = v(f)
\]
and this definition applied to the coordinate functions $x^i$ (yielding $dx^i$)
coincides with the definition above. Note that $\partial_i$ form a basis for
$T_pM$ and $dx^i$ form a basis for $T_p^*M$. Tensor products of them, then, form
a basis for the tensor product space.

\begin{hw}
    Prove that, for a vector space $V$ with basis $v_i$, dual basis $v^i$, the
    set
    \[
        \{v^i\otimes v^j\ |\ 1\leq i,j\leq n\}
    \]
    forms a basis for $V^*\otimes V^*$. Here $v^i\otimes v^j(u,v) =
    v^i(u)v^j(v)$.
\end{hw}

\section{Affine Connections}

\begin{defn}
    Let $M^n$ be a smooth manifold of dimension $n$. A {\em Riemannian Metric}
    $g$ on $M$ is a rank $(0,2)$ tensor (a section of $T^*M\otimes T^*M$) that
    is symmetric and positive-definite. In other words, $g$ is a rank $(0,2)$
    tensor that restricts to an inner product on the tangent space at every
    point.
\end{defn}

We can express $g$ in local coordinates!
\[
    g_{ij} = g(\partial_i,\partial_j)
\]
or
\[
    g = g_{ij}dx^i\otimes dx^j
\]
